## T.M.I. (Task Management Interface)

I created the T.M.I. app because I recognized a need for a more streamlined, efficient way to manage tasks. In both personal and professional life, people often struggle to organize their to-do lists and prioritize their responsibilities effectively. This struggle can lead to stress, missed deadlines, and a decrease in productivity.

T.M.I. addresses this by offering an intuitive platform where users can easily create, manage, and track their tasks. With a focus on user experience, it simplifies task organization, helping individuals and teams stay on top of their responsibilities without feeling overwhelmed.
