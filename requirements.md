## Vision:

- T.M.I., short for Task Management Interface, is all about making your life easier. I want it to be your go-to app for managing your tasks, whether they're for work or your personal life. I am taking on the hassle of juggling tasks and deadlines, and turning it into something simple and stress-free. T.M.I. is worth your attention because it's built to save you time, take away stress, and help you get more done.

## Scope (In/Out):

### IN:

- Easy to use: With T.M.I., you can create, manage, and track tasks simply without any fuss.

- Prioritize: I'll help you figure out which tasks need your attention first by attention to your custom deadlines.

- Teamwork: T.M.I. makes it easy for teams to work together and keep track of their tasks.

- Stay in the loop: With T.M.I., you'll be able to visually prioritize upcoming tasks.

### OUT:

- T.M.I. is all about simplistic tasks input, so I am not planning on adding any complex organization features.

- T.M.I. is for managing tasks, not for social media-style chats or posts.

## Minimum Viable Product:

- At its core, T.M.I. lets you create, edit, and delete tasks, figure out what's most important, and work together with your team.

## Stretch Goals:

- I am looking to add more app integrations to make T.M.I. even more useful.

- In the future, I might add smart features that learn how you work and give you personalized tips.

- I'd also like to bring T.M.I. to your smartphone for easy access wherever you are.
